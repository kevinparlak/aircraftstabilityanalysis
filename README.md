AERSP 424 - Advanced Computer Programming project

This project was developed in AERSP 424 - Advanced Computer Programming at Penn State University.  Members of the design team involved in contributions to this code were: Kevin Parlak and Evan Donkus.

The intent of this project was to incorporate object-oriented programming using C++ and other concepts learned throughout the semester into a piece of developed software.  My group decided to create a calculation tool for aircraft stability problems.  We created a graphical user interface using Microsoft Foundation Class and incorporated various dynamic and static input options to allow the user to easily calculate properties of stability problems.
